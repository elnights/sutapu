  This is the default 404 page.  
  User agents that don't "Accept" HTML will see a JSON version instead.
  You can customize the control logic for your needs in `config/404.js`

  Sails considers a request to be in a "404: Not Found" state when a user
  requests a URL which doesn't match any of your app's routes or blueprints.
